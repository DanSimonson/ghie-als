          <p>
            Hi there, I'm Gina Simonson and I teach basic education to ALS
            students.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been teaching ALS for over 16 years and was educated at De La
            Salle University. When you enter my classroom, whether virtual or in
            person, you will experience a safe and motivating environment to
            help you reach your full potential.

          <h1>Teaching ALS in the new normal setting requires new methods </h1>
          <p>
            Itâ€™s been a challenge for teachers and learners because of the new
            learning setting. Face to face teaching is not an option. New
            methods and techniques are needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new normal teaching will combine individual study with online
            classroom work where learners learn at their own pace with guided
            modules
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the teaching tecniques change, the goal remains the same...
            to tap into students' passions and allow them to feel a connection
            to the curriculum, empowering them to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            This interactive website is one of the new modalities in the new
            normal setting to equip learners for success.
